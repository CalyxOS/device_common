      "message": "This will have the side effect of leaving partitions partially flashed, which isn\u0027t better or worse than what\u0027s happening before this change. Could we add a check for the devices that require unlock_critical and abort if it\u0027s not unlocked? This is already in the flasher but not in the scripts",

      "message": "I can look into that.\n\nAs far as unlock_critical goes, at least for FP5, the first partition to be flashed requires unlock_critical, so if it\u0027s not available, the process will stop before anything has been changed. I was able to verify that.\n\nBut you raise a good point.\n\nIt might also be a good idea to flash to the non-active slot first or something, the way we do with bootloader- for other devices. Then at least it would only be one slot that was having issues.",
